        <div class="disease-section">
            <h4>Diabetes</h4>
            <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>
            <h5>Symptoms</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Urinating often.</li>
                <li>Feeling very thirsty.</li>
                <li>Extreme fatigue.</li>
                <li>Blurry vision.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="disease-section">
            <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
            <p>Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.</p>
            <h5>Symptoms</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
                <li>Change in the size, shape, or appearance of a breast</li>
                <li>Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling</li>
                <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="disease-section">
            <h4>Chronic Kidney Disease</h4>
            <p>Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes, and wastes can build up in your body.</p>
            <h5>Symptoms</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Vomiting</li>
                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                <li>Muscle twitches and cramps</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="disease-section">
            <h4>Liver Disease</h4>
            <p>Symptoms of liver disease can vary, but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs, bruising easily, changes in the color of your stool and urine, and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class="disease-section">
            <h4>Malaria</h4>
            <p>Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.</p>
            <h5>Symptoms</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever. This is the most common symptom.</li>
                <li>Chills</li>
                <li>Headache</li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="disease-section">
            <h4>Pneumonia</h4>
            <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>
            <h5>Symptoms</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Cough, which may produce greenish, yellow, or even bloody mucus.</li>
                <li>Fever, sweating, and shaking chills.</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
                <li>Rapid, shallow breathing.</li>
            </ul>
